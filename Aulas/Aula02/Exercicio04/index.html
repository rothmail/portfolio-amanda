                Before I begin, I applaud what Dora The Explorer tries to accomplish. Shows like Sesame Street want to
                teach
                kids about other cultures and languages. I think a kid's show that lets kids learn about another culture
                and
                language is a good thing. We need more shows like this.

                The problem with the show is its execution. First of all, I feel that Dora treats their young audience
                like idiots. They expect the child to scream the answers to Dora at the T.V.; as if she'll hear them.
                Second, the show has a shrill way of getting its point across. Dora, Boots, the Knapsack, the Map and
                everybody else talk down to the audience or simply come off as annoying. The songs and writing are weak
                and the voice-acting will give you a headache. The Map, especially, grates on me. There is way too much
                repetitiveness and it's tiring to see Dora asking for help whenever she comes to an obstacle. She's not
                much of an explorer.

                The worse part of the show is the fact that there is NOTHING here that an adult can enjoy. The ride is
                as saccharine as it gets. Also, the animation is pretty blah. It's full of colors but it won't win any
                awards for its technical brilliance.
