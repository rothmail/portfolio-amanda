        <h1>The Scream</h1>
        <p class="scream-p">
            The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the
            piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur
            (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art,
            seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative
            influence on the Expressionist movement.[1]

        <p class="scream-p">
            Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the
            clouds "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the spot
            along a fjord path overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested various explanations for the unnaturally orange
            sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's
            commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.
